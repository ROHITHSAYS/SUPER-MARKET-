Supermarket Billing System
This software project is a traditional supermarket billing system with some added functionality. This system is built for fast data processing and bill generation for supermarket customers. The billing system consists of an sql database and effective front end designed in Asp.net. The billing database is a vast collection of product name, price and other product specific data. A product when billed is searched from the database and its price is added to the bill based upon the product quantity. The system also contains discounts on various products so that the product is offered at discounted price while billing.
